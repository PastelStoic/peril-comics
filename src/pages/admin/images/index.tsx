// build list of all images, paginated and searchable
// can also filter those that are in a particular comic, or not in any comic
// each has a title, a date uploaded, and a button to delete it from the system.
// if the image is part of a comic, the delete will fail
// there will also be a link to the "upload new" page 
// is this needed? might it not be better to have uploads/deletes be directly part of the comic editor page?
